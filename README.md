# 🎵 LyricsCounter

A simple and elegant web tool that allows users to **count how many times a specific word appears in any song lyrics** — supporting both **English and Arabic** text.

🔍 Just paste the lyrics, type the word you want to count, and hit **Count Words**.  
✨ *The idea was inspired by Amr Diab’s song “Shaif Amar” 😂*
